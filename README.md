How Habit Works ⚙️
Habit is built on the powerful MERN stack, providing a robust, efficient, and scalable system for users to track their habits in real-time. Let’s break it down:

Frontend (React.js): The user interface is built using React, a JavaScript library known for its fast, dynamic updates. Our interface is designed to make it easy for you to manage your habits, visualize your progress, and get real-time feedback without having to refresh the page.

Backend (Node.js & Express.js): The backend handles all the heavy lifting. Written in Node.js and Express, it handles server-side logic, manages routing, and communicates with the database to store and retrieve your data. It also ensures that login and authentication are secure, using best practices to protect your information.

Database (MongoDB): Your habits, goals, and progress are securely stored in a MongoDB database. This NoSQL database is ideal for storing large volumes of data while providing flexibility and scalability. Whether you're tracking one habit or hundreds, MongoDB ensures your data is stored efficiently.

Real-Time Syncing: Thanks to React and its state management system, your data is updated in real-time, giving you immediate feedback on your progress. You never have to worry about manually refreshing the page – Habit does it all for you!
